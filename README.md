# Entra docs mirror

The Microsoft Entra pages on Microsoft Learn, as Markdown, one file per page at
the path of the source file Learn built it from. It stands in for
`MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs` for when that repository stops being public: every
commit here is a crawl that found something new on Learn, so the history of
this repository is the history of the published docs.

- `learn-mirror.config.json` picks the sitemaps and pages to mirror, and
  `sourceRepos` keeps out pages other repositories publish under the same
  Learn paths.
- `.learn-mirror/state.json` records each page's ETag and the publish metadata
  stripped from its front matter, so a run only downloads pages that changed
  and a republish is not a diff.
- `.github/workflows/mirror-learn.yml` calls the engine's shared mirror
  workflow in `merill/dailynews-engine` four times a day.
