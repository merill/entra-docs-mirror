# Configure Harmony for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID - Microsoft Entra ID | Microsoft Learn

In this article, you learn how to integrate Harmony with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Harmony with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

- Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Harmony.
- Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Harmony with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
- Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

- A Microsoft Entra user account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
- One of the following roles:
    - [Application Administrator](/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator)
    - [Cloud Application Administrator](/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator)
    - [Application Owner](/en-us/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications).

- Harmony single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

Note

Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Scenario description

In this article, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

- Harmony supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Harmony from the gallery

To configure the integration of Harmony into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Harmony from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator).
2. Browse to **Entra ID** &gt; **Enterprise apps** &gt; **New application**.
3. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Harmony** in the search box.
4. Select **Harmony** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards](/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides).

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Harmony

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Harmony using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Harmony.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Harmony, perform the following steps:

1. **Configure Microsoft Entra SSO**- to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    2. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **Configure Harmony SSO**- to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **Create Harmony test user** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Harmony that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
3. **Test SSO** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator).
2. Browse to **Entra ID** &gt; **Enterprise apps** &gt; **Harmony** &gt; **Single sign-on**.
3. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
4. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

    ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)
5. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the application is pre-configured and the necessary URLs are already pre-populated with Azure. The user needs to save the configuration by selecting the **Save** button.
6. Harmony application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

    ![image](common/default-attributes.png)
7. In addition to above, Harmony application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

    | Name | Source Attribute |
    | --- | --- |
    | Email | user.userprincipalname |
8. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

9. On the **Set up Harmony** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Create a Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you create a test user called B.Simon.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [User Administrator](../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#user-administrator).
2. Browse to **Entra ID** &gt; **Users**.
3. Select **New user** &gt; **Create new user**, at the top of the screen.
4. In the **User**properties, follow these steps:
    1. In the **Display name** field, enter `B.Simon`.
    2. In the **User principal name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
    3. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
    4. Select **Review + create**.
5. Select **Create**.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to Harmony.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator).
2. Browse to **Entra ID** &gt; **Enterprise apps** &gt; **Harmony**.
3. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
4. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
5. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then select the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
6. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then select the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, select the **Assign** button.

## Configure Harmony SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Harmony** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Harmony support team](https://us.moodmedia.com/contact-us/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Harmony test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Harmony. Work with [Harmony support team](https://us.moodmedia.com/contact-us/) to add the users in the Harmony platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

- Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Harmony for which you set up the SSO.
- You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Harmony tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Harmony for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).
