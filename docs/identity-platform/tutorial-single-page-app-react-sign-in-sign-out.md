This tutorial is the final part of a series that demonstrates building a React single-page application (SPA) and preparing it for authentication using the Microsoft identity platform. In [part 2 of this series](tutorial-single-page-app-react-configure-authentication), you added functional components to a React SPA and built a responsive UI. This final step shows you how to test sign-in and sign-out functionality in your app.

In this tutorial, you:

- Add code to the *claimUtils.js* file to create the claims table
- Sign in and sign out of the application
- View the claims returned from the ID token

## Prerequisites

- Completion of the prerequisites and steps in [Tutorial: Create components for sign in and sign out in a React single-page app](tutorial-single-page-app-react-configure-authentication).

## Add code to the *claimUtils.js* file (optional)

To add the feature of a table that can display claims returned from the ID token, you can add code to *claimUtils.js* file. This code snippet will populate the claims table with the appropriate description and corresponding value.

1. Open *utils/claimUtils.js* and add the following code snippet:

```javascript
export const createClaimsTable = (claims) => {
    let claimsObj = {};
    let index = 0;

    Object.keys(claims).forEach((key) => {
        if (typeof claims[key] !== 'string' && typeof claims[key] !== 'number') return;
        switch (key) {
            case 'aud':
                populateClaim(
                    key,
                    claims[key],
                    "Identifies the intended recipient of the token. In ID tokens, the audience is your app's Application ID, assigned to your app in the Microsoft Entra admin center.",
                    index,
                    claimsObj
                );
                index++;
                break;
            case 'iss':
                populateClaim(
                    key,
                    claims[key],
                    'Identifies the issuer, or authorization server that constructs and returns the token. It also identifies the external tenant for which the user was authenticated.

                    index,
                    claimsObj

                index++;
                break;
            case 'iat':
                populateClaim(
                    key,
                    changeDateFormat(claims[key]),

                index++;
                break;
            case 'nbf':
                populateClaim(
                    key,
                    changeDateFormat(claims[key]),
                    'The nbf (not before) claim identifies the time (as UNIX timestamp) before which the JWT must not be accepted for processing.',

## Run your project and sign in

Now that all the required code snippets have been added, the application can be called and tested in a web browser.

1. Open a new terminal and run the following command to start your express web server.

    ```console
    npm start
    ```
2. Copy the `http` URL that appears in the terminal, for example, `http://localhost:3000`, and paste it into a browser. We recommend using a private or incognito browser session.
3. Sign-in with an account registered to the tenant.
4. An interface similar to the following screenshot appears, indicating that you have signed in to the application. If you have added the claims table, you can view the claims returned from the ID token.

## Sign out from the application

1. Find the **Sign out** button on the page, and select it.
2. You'll be prompted to pick an account to sign out from. Select the account you used to sign in.

A message appears indicating that you have signed out. You can now close the browser window.
